Opinionated
-----------
It is a design smell that a library opens with asking you a lot of questions or to fill in a lot of twitchy config before simple scenarious work.

An opinionated library has an opinion about the right way to do it. That said, if the library can discover existing conventions, it should discover them and used them.

Other libraries with different opinions exist, see below.

No Config, No Regex
-------------------
If the config is more complex than re-writing the code from scratch, there is something wrong with a library.

These contraints enable "drop in and go"

Don't contaminate the package
-----------------------------
Other than creating __init__.py, __version__.py, etc, no code should contaminate the users setup.py, nor package folder. No code should have to run in __version__.py or the like, for example, nothing like `__version__ = run_git_command_to_find_version()`, it should be equal to a constant. The use of jiggle_version should not increase the number of dependencies.

Provide a vendorization option
------
It should be an effortless & license-compatible way to just copy this next to setup.py

Don't do too many things unrelated to versioning
------------------------------------------------
Don't run tests, create manifests, etc.

Provide a multiple interfaces
------
- Command line - e.g. `jiggle_version here`
- import - e.g. `import jiggle_version; jiggle_version.go()`
- setup plugin - e.g. 'setup.py jiggle_version', e.g.


    setup_requires=['jiggle_version'],
    use_jiggle_version=True,
    
or

    cmdclass=jiggle_version_command,


Don't force the developer to create irrelevant things
--------
For example, if there is no README.md, don't make me create one.

Don't update natural language files
-----
There is no way to do this without programming-like configuration. Your README.md might say, "In versions 0.1.0 there were bugs and in 2.0.0 they were fixed." There is no way to update that string with a zero-config app.

Build Incremeter
----------------
 - Major - The change is big.
 - Minor - The change breaks compatibility. This might be detectable with a unit test runner,  or maybe even by detecting
changes to public interfaces (not that such a concept exists in python) but otherwise is too hard for machines.
 - Patch - This is the small number that increases each build. jiggle_version *only* solves the problem of incrementing this
number.

Files Targeted
--------------
/__init__.py  - __version__ = "1.1.1"

/__version__.py - __version__ = "1.1.1"

TODO: _version.py - I think this is a place to pipe a version string from a version control system that isn't expected to be executable? Not sure. It is a common convention. Versioneer puts library code here.

TODO: version.txt - Some tools put/expect just the version string here.

/setup.cfg  version=1.1.1

We take the first of these, increment the patch, and re-write those 3 files. If they don't exist, they will be created
with only the version number filled in.

We make no particular effort to parse wild text. If your current number is so messed up that you need regex to ID it,
then edit it by hand.

Other way to get/provide version:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7079735/how-do-i-get-the-version-of-an-installed-module-in-python-programatically

    import pkg_resources
    version = pkg_resources.get_distribution("nose").version

Flipside Question
-----------------
What version am I depending on? If you want to check the version of a dependency, you might be better off doing feature detection, i.e. check if name of some function exists and then use it.

Which Version Wins?
------------------
You can get a version from your git tag, from anyone of the existing .py or config files.

I think the tagger should set tags based on what is in the __version__.py file. Forcing the user to check in, tag
and so on before bumping a version is no fun.


Relevant PEPs
-------------

Semantic Version - https://semver.org/ - Outside of python-world, this is catching on.
 
345 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0345/#version

386 - SUPERCEDED https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/

396- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0396/#specification

440 - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/ - Most libraries use this.

Conflicts
--------
If you use pbr or bumpversion with jiggle_version you may have conflicts. All-in-one tools are most likely to conflict.


Design Decisions
----------------
- What version is canonical? 
    - User supplied. (No. This should be zero touch.) 
    - Discovered in source (Yes, preferably)
    - Discovered in pip/pip package/pypi (Yes, but as fallback.)
    - VCS supplied, e.g. git/mercurial, etc (Yes, but as fallback)
- What is the next version?
    - User supplies. (No. This should be zero touch. Maybe option for bumping minor/major)
    - Search for it, increment it (Yes)
    - Provide default, e.g. 0.1.0 (Yes)
- How do you parse the version?
    - User supplied regex (ha, ha, wait... some libs do this. No!) 
    - ast (i.e. eval the source code) (Yes, via 3rd party lib)
    - string parsing (Yes, via 3rd party lib)
    - library supplied regex (Yes, via 3rd party lib)
- How do you interpret the version or compare versions?
    - [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) Yes.
    - Semantic Version - Yes.
    - User supplied ad-hoc-  (No.)
    - Opaque strings (no way to auto-bump) (No.)
    - Other, e.g. Microsoft versions, for cross platform deployment. (No.)
- How do you record the new version?
    - Update files. (Yes.)
    - Update VCS (commit, push, tag, etc). (Yes via option)
- How do you integrate with other build steps?
    - standalone. (Yes.)
    - bump version along with other steps, like packaging and pushing to pypi. (Option for git tagging.)

Git Centric
-----------
These all either run `git describe --tags` to find a version or `git tag %` to bump a version.

 - Git/VCS centric - setup.py plugins
    - [python-versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer) Git tags hold canonical version. Setup.py plugin command. `versioneer install`. Vendorizes itself to your souce tree. Edit `setup.py` and `setup.cfg`. Run `python versioneer.py setup` This adds a lot of code to your source tree. Has bug where it only works if the version code file is _version.py. This was just very twitchy to setup. Library code has to run to get the version, e.g. ` python -c "import ver_test1; print(ver_test1.__version__)"` Personally, I don't like how this library infects the production release. I'd rather my build dependencies gone by final release.
    - [setupext-gitversion](https://pypi.org/project/setupext-gitversion/) Git tag driven version bumping. Pep440. Requires [git_version] section in setup.cfg, add `from setupext import gitversion` and wire up a plug-in, then to run, `python setup.py git_version` I couldn't evaluate further because it blew up inspecting my git repo.

- Git/VCS centric
    - [python-git-version](https://github.com/aebrahim/python-git-version) Git holds canonical version. Library is expected to be vendorized (copied next to your setup.py). Code runs in __version__. ` python version.py` returns version found in tag. EXxecute with `python setup.py sdist` - as far as I can tell, it specifies the package version and doesn't expect to be used from code after deployment. 

    - [pyver](https://pypi.org/project/pyver/) SUPERCEDED BY *versioneer* Pep440. Expects tag to already exist. Invoked in setup.py, used for package version.

    - [katversion](https://pypi.org/project/katversion/) Implemented as setup.py 'extension'. Expects __init__.py to exist. Ignores __init__.py and does not update the __version__ value. Does update package version with string drived from git tags and history.

    - [zest releaser](http://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - VCS driven versionbump command
    
    - [vdt](https://pypi.org/project/vdt.version/) Git and Jenkins centric version bumping with other actions built in. Command line `version`. Python 2 only. I'm not going to have time to test it out.
    
    - [pbr](https://pypi.org/project/pbr/) - quirky git tag driven version bumping and a bunch of other things. You can't turn off the version bumping, so it will conflict with any other version bumper you use. Appears to affect package version, the one you see in the /dist/ folder.
    
    - bumpversion & bump2version - I don't know how this works. Frustration trying to get bumpversion to work at all drove me to create jiggle-version. bump2version is a fork for fixing bugs because bumpversion is/was dormant. Not linking until the maintainers return 6 hours of my life that they stole.
    
- Only Git Tags
    - [git-bump-version](https://pypi.org/project/git-bump-version/) Command line `git_bump_version` searches for last tag and tags current. Blows up on "v1.2.3" As far as I can tell, this code is agnostic to what your source code is, i.e. it doesn't edit __version__.py, etc.

- Other VCS
    - [mercurial_update_version](https://pypi.org/project/mercurial_update_version/) Merucrial holds your canonical version. Not going to test...I don't use
    

 Source Centric
 --------------
 Source centric version bumpers read and update .py or config files. They do not necessarily require or expect you to have source control tagging going on.
 
  - Source Centric -- `__init__.py` or `__version__.py`
    - [changes](https://github.com/michaeljoseph/changes) - Does many release related things. `changes my_module bump_version` to bump version, but this code will not run unless readme.md exists, etc. Detect version from source. Does not suggest new version, you must manually type it.
    - [pylease](https://pypi.org/project/pylease/) Version bumper, release tool [repo here](https://github.com/bagrat/pylease) Not python 3 compatible (blows up on CondigParser on pip install)

  
  - Source Centric - `Version.txt`
    - [metapensiero.tool.bump_version](https://pypi.org/project/metapensiero.tool.bump_version/) Version.txt manager. Looks like it avoids dealing with any python source code, etc. Command line only, supports 4 schemes : auto,pep440,simple2,simple3,simple4. Usage: `bump_version -s simple3 -f tiny
`
  - Source Centric - `setup.py`, e.g. `python setup.py --version`
    - [incremental](https://pypi.org/project/incremental/) `_version.py` updator. If I understand, this lib becomes a dependency of your release app, i.e. it isn't just a build dependency. Pep440 only. Usage `python -m incremental.update my_module --patch`


Parsing the complex Version Object
----------------------------------
There are many libraries for dealing with the version string as a rich structured object with meaningful parts and a PEP to conform to. jiggle_version itself relies on semantic_version.

- Semantic Version Centric
    - [semantic_version](https://pypi.org/project/semantic_version/)
- Pep 440 Centric
    - [Versio](https://pypi.org/project/Versio/) Supports PEP 440, 2 ad-hoc simple schemes and Perl versions. version.bump(). Micro-library- 2 files.
    - [pep440](https://pypi.org/project/pep440/) Is the version string pep440 valid. Microlib, 2 functions, 1 file.
    - [parver](https://pypi.org/project/parver/) PEP 440 centric. Version.bump_release() to increment
    - dist_utils.version - Has a version parsing and comparing object.
- Other
    - [cmp-version](https://pypi.org/project/cmp_version/) - Command line interface only(?) Release-General-Epoch scheme.
    

Version Finders
---------------

- VCS centric
 - [version_hunter](https://pypi.org/project/version-hunter/) Seems to be more focused on finding a version from a source code tree & not in bumping it.

 - [git-version](https://pypi.org/project/git-version/) Version finding from your git repo
 
 - [tcversioner](https://pypi.org/project/tcversioner/) Find version via vcs tag. Writes version.txt

- Source Tree centric
 - [get_version](https://pypi.org/project/get_version/) Searches source tree? Local pip package?
 - [bernardomg.version-extractor](https://pypi.org/project/bernardomg.version-extractor/) Extract version from source code. 2 functions (microlib) that find __version__ inside of __init__.py
 - Other-
    - [package_version pypi](https://pypi.org/project/package-version/) - [package_version](https://github.com/Yuav/python-package-version) Assume pypi has your canoncial version, use pip to find the last version to bump.
    - [setuptools-requirements-vcs-version](https://github.com/danielbrownridge/setuptools-requirements-vcs-version) Find version in requirements.txt found by searching git url! Not sure what scenario this is for.

Django
------
[django-fe-version](https://pypi.org/project/django-fe-version/) Adds a /version/ endpoint to your web app.

[django-project-version](https://pypi.org/project/django-project-version/) same..
