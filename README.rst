jiggle_version
==============

Opinionated, no config build version incrementer. No regex. Drop in and
go.

::

    pip install jiggle_library

    cd src
    # should run from same folder with setup.py
    # or parent folder of my_project/__init__.py

    jiggle_library here
    # find, bump & update version strings in source code

    git --tag $(jiggle_library find)

Depends on cmp-version, docopt, parver, semantic-version, versio, which
your application is unlikely to depend on.

Problem to be solved
--------------------

There are up to 1/2 dozen places to update a version string. You scoff,
‘Can’t be!’ But for a mature code base, it is because so many tools
expect version strings in different places:

-  \__init__.py has \__version_\_
-  so does \__version__.py
-  so does the setup function in setup.py
-  so does the setup.cfg if you are doing cofig driven setup.py
-  your git repo might need a tag matching the library version
-  you might need a plain text version.txt

You will need to find the current version, bump the most minor part-
which varies depending on if you are using pep440, semantic version or
something else, update all the places where you could update and re-do
this as often as each build and at least as often as each package and
push to pypi.

Opinionated
-----------

A library should have one working, no-options, no questions asked
scenario, e.g.

::

    jiggle_library here
    # find, bump & update version strings in source code

An opinionated library has an opinion about the right way to do it. That
said, if the library can discover existing conventions, it should
discover them and use them.

The following contraints enable “drop in and go”

No Config, No Regex
-------------------

If the config is more complex than re-writing the code from scratch,
there is something wrong with a library.

Don’t contaminate the package
-----------------------------

Other than creating \__init__.py, \__version__.py, etc, no code should
contaminate the users setup.py, nor package folder. No code should have
to run in \__version__.py or the like, for example, nothing like
``\_\_version\_\_ = run_git_command_to_find_version()``, it should be
equal to a constant. The use of jiggle_version should not increase the
number of dependencies.

Provide a vendorization option
------------------------------

It should be an effortless & license-compatible way to just copy this
next to setup.py.

This isn’t achieved yet.

Don’t do too many things unrelated to versioning
------------------------------------------------

Don’t run tests, create manifests, create a package, force checkins &
tags, etc.

Provide a multiple interfaces
-----------------------------

A build tool shouldn’t assume any particular build system.

-  *Bash:* Command line - e.g. ``jiggle_version here``
-  *python*: import - e.g.
   ``import jiggle_version; jiggle_version.go()``
-  *setup.py*: plugin - e.g. ‘setup.py jiggle_version’, e.g.

   setup_requires=[‘jiggle_version’], use_jiggle_version=True,

or

::

    cmdclass=jiggle_version_command,

Don’t argue over a patch version
--------------------------------

If multiple versions are detected, but are close, e.g. 1.2.3 and 1.2.4,
just use 1.2.4. This is the most common real world sync problem.

Don’t force the developer to create irrelevant things
-----------------------------------------------------

For example, if there is no README.md, don’t make me create one.

Don’t update natural language files
-----------------------------------

There is no way to do this without programming-like configuration. Your
README.md might say, “In versions 0.1.0 there were bugs and in 2.0.0
they were fixed.” There is no way to update that string with a
zero-config app.

Don’t execute anything at post-deployment runtime
-------------------------------------------------

Nothing succeeds as reliably as assigning a constant.

No matter how clever or well tested your code is, executing code as
post-deployment runtime is an additional dependency and failure point.

``__version__.py``:

::

    version = query_pyi()
    version = query_package_metadata()
    version = search_for_and_read_text_or_config()

Automatically Bump “Minor”/“Path”/“Build”, let user manually update “Major”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It should be uncommon to need record a big version change. You can do
that manually. It would require AI to bump anything but the patch/build
number.

-  Major - The change is big.
-  Minor - The change breaks compatibility. This might be detectable
   with a unit test runner, or maybe even by detecting changes to public
   interfaces (not that such a concept exists in python) but otherwise
   is too hard for machines.
-  Patch - This is the small number that increases each build.
   jiggle_version *only* solves the problem of incrementing this number.

Files Targeted
--------------

/__init__.py - ``__version__ = "1.1.1"``

/__version__.py - ``__version__ = "1.1.1"``

TODO: \_version.py - I think this is a place to pipe a version string
from a version control system that isn’t expected to be executable? Not
sure. It is a common convention. Versioneer puts library code here.

TODO: version.txt - Some tools put/expect just the version string here.
It works well with bash & doesn’t require a parser of any sort.

/setup.cfg ``version=1.1.1``

We take the first of these, increment the patch, and re-write those 3
files. If they don’t exist, they will be created with only the version
number filled in.

We make no particular effort to parse wild text. If your current number
is so messed up that you need regex to ID it, then edit it by hand.

Other way to get/provide version:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7079735/how-do-i-get-the-version-of-an-installed-module-in-python-programatically

::

    import pkg_resources
    version = pkg_resources.get_distribution("nose").version

Flipside Question
-----------------

What version am I depending on? If you want to check the version of a
dependency, you might be better off doing feature detection, i.e. check
if name of some function exists and then use it.

::

    # Don't
    if some_lib.__version__ > Version("1.1.1"):
        some_lib.some_method()

    # Do
    try:
       some_lib.some_method
    except:
       some_method = fallback

Which Version Wins?
-------------------

You can get a version from your git tag, from anyone of the existing .py
or config files.

jiggle_version at the moment demands that all found versions match
before bumping. There is no rational way to decide which version of a
list of candidates is better.

Conflicts with Build Libraries
------------------------------

If you use certain libraries, e.g. pbr, with jiggle_version you may have
conflicts. All-in-one tools are most likely to conflict.

Weird Edge Cases
----------------

Multi-module packages Submodules Packages with no python

Relevant PEPs
-------------

`Semantic Version <https://semver.org/>`__ Outside of python-world, this
is catching on. I *think* SemVer is a subset of PEP 440.

`440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/>`__ - Pythons most
mature words on versions.

`PyPA’s
Advice <https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/>`__

Some other peps that mention versions tangentially:
`345 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0345/#version>`__ and
`396 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0396/#specification>`__ which
is deferred. 386 is superceded.

Parsing the complex Version Object
----------------------------------

There are many libraries for dealing with the version string as a rich
structured object with meaningful parts and a PEP to conform to.
jiggle_version itself relies on semantic_version.

-  Semantic Version Centric

   -  `semantic_version <https://pypi.org/project/semantic_version/>`__

-  Pep 440 Centric

   -  `Versio <https://pypi.org/project/Versio/>`__ Supports PEP 440, 2
      ad-hoc simple schemes and Perl versions. version.bump().
      Micro-library- 2 files.
   -  `pep440 <https://pypi.org/project/pep440/>`__ Is the version
      string pep440 valid. Microlib, 2 functions, 1 file.
   -  `parver <https://pypi.org/project/parver/>`__ PEP 440 centric.
      Version.bump_release() to increment
   -  dist_utils.version - Has a version parsing and comparing object.

-  Other

   -  `cmp-version <https://pypi.org/project/cmp_version/>`__ - Command
      line interface only(?) Release-General-Epoch scheme.

Git Centric
-----------

These all either run ``git describe --tags`` to find a version or
``git tag %`` to bump a version.

-  Git/VCS centric - setup.py plugins

   -  `python-versioneer <https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer>`__
      Git tags hold canonical version. Setup.py plugin command.
      ``versioneer install``. Vendorizes itself to your souce tree. Edit
      ``setup.py`` and ``setup.cfg``. Run ``python versioneer.py setup``
      This adds a lot of code to your source tree. Has bug where it only
      works if the version code file is \_version.py. This was just very
      twitchy to setup. Library code has to run to get the version, e.g.
      ``python -c "import ver_test1; print(ver_test1.\_\_version\_\_)"``
      Personally, I don’t like how this library infects the production
      release. I’d rather my build dependencies gone by final release.
   -  `setupext-gitversion <https://pypi.org/project/setupext-gitversion/>`__
      Git tag driven version bumping. Pep440. Requires [git_version]
      section in setup.cfg, add ``from setupext import gitversion`` and
      wire up a plug-in, then to run, ``python setup.py git_version`` I
      couldn’t evaluate further because it blew up inspecting my git
      repo.

-  Git/VCS centric

   -  `python-git-version <https://github.com/aebrahim/python-git-version>`__
      Git holds canonical version. Library is expected to be vendorized
      (copied next to your setup.py). Code runs in \__version__.
      ``python version.py`` returns version found in tag. EXxecute with
      ``python setup.py sdist`` - as far as I can tell, it specifies the
      package version and doesn’t expect to be used from code after
      deployment.

   -  `pyver <https://pypi.org/project/pyver/>`__ SUPERCEDED BY
      *versioneer* Pep440. Expects tag to already exist. Invoked in
      setup.py, used for package version.

   -  `katversion <https://pypi.org/project/katversion/>`__ Implemented
      as setup.py ‘extension’. Expects \__init__.py to exist. Ignores
      \__init__.py and does not update the \__version_\_ value. Does
      update package version with string drived from git tags and
      history.

   -  `zest releaser <http://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
      - VCS driven versionbump command

   -  `vdt <https://pypi.org/project/vdt.version/>`__ Git and Jenkins
      centric version bumping with other actions built in. Command line
      ``version``. Python 2 only. I’m not going to have time to test it
      out.

   -  `pbr <https://pypi.org/project/pbr/>`__ - quirky git tag driven
      version bumping and a bunch of other things. You can’t turn off
      the version bumping, so it will conflict with any other version
      bumper you use. Appears to affect package version, the one you see
      in the /dist/ folder.

   -  bumpversion & bump2version - I don’t know how this works.
      Frustration trying to get bumpversion to work at all drove me to
      create jiggle-version. bump2version is a fork for fixing bugs
      because bumpversion is/was dormant. Not linking until the
      maintainers return 6 hours of my life that they stole.

-  Only Git Tags

   -  `git-bump-version <https://pypi.org/project/git-bump-version/>`__
      Command line ``git_bump_version`` searches for last tag and tags
      current. Blows up on “v1.2.3” As far as I can tell, this code is
      agnostic to what your source code is, i.e. it doesn’t edit
      \__version__.py, etc.

-  Other VCS

   -  `mercurial_update_version <https://pypi.org/project/mercurial_update_version/>`__
      Merucrial holds your canonical version. Not going to test…I don’t
      use
   -  `setuptools_scm <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools_scm/>`__ Git
      & mercurial. Gets version from tag. Add this to setup() in
      setup.py
      :``use_scm_version=True, setup_requires=['setuptools_scm'],`` No
      version strings in source at all & package still builds to /dist/
      with expected version.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

-  Source Centric – ``\_\_init\_\_.py`` or ``\_\_version\_\_.py``

   -  `changes <https://github.com/michaeljoseph/changes>`__ - Does many
      release related things. ``changes my_module bump_version`` to bump
      version, but this code will not run unless readme.md exists, etc.
      Detect version from source. Does not suggest new version, you must
      manually type it.
   -  `pylease <https://pypi.org/project/pylease/>`__ Version bumper,
      release tool `repo here <https://github.com/bagrat/pylease>`__ Not
      python 3 compatible (blows up on CondigParser on pip install)

-  Source Centric - ``Version.txt``

   -  `metapensiero.tool.bump_version <https://pypi.org/project/metapensiero.tool.bump_version/>`__
      Version.txt manager. Looks like it avoids dealing with any python
      source code, etc. Command line only, supports 4 schemes :
      auto,pep440,simple2,simple3,simple4. Usage:
      ``bump_version -s simple3 -f tiny``

-  Source Centric - ``setup.py``, e.g. ``python setup.py --version``

   -  `incremental <https://pypi.org/project/incremental/>`__
      ``_version.py`` updator. If I understand, this lib becomes a
      dependency of your release app, i.e. it isn’t just a build
      dependency. Pep440 only. Usage
      ``python -m incremental.update my_module --patch``

Version Finders
---------------

-  VCS centric

   -  `version_hunter <https://pypi.org/project/version-hunter/>`__
      Seems to be more focused on finding a version from a source code
      tree & not in bumping it.

   -  `git-version <https://pypi.org/project/git-version/>`__ Version
      finding from your git repo

   -  `tcversioner <https://pypi.org/project/tcversioner/>`__ Find
      version via vcs tag. Writes version.txt

-  Source Tree centric

   -  `get_version <https://pypi.org/project/get_version/>`__ Searches
      source tree? Local pip package?
   -  `bernardomg.version-extractor <https://pypi.org/project/bernardomg.version-extractor/>`__
      Extract version from source code. 2 functions (microlib) that find
      \__version_\_ inside of \__init__.py

-  Other-

   -  `package_version
      pypi <https://pypi.org/project/package-version/>`__ -
      `package_version <https://github.com/Yuav/python-package-version>`__
      Assume pypi has your canoncial version, use pip to find the last
      version to bump.
   -  `setuptools-requirements-vcs-version <https://github.com/danielbrownridge/setuptools-requirements-vcs-version>`__
      Find version in requirements.txt found by searching git url! Not
      sure what scenario this is for.

Django
------

`django-fe-version <https://pypi.org/project/django-fe-version/>`__ Adds
a /version/ endpoint to your web app.

`django-project-version <https://pypi.org/project/django-project-version/>`__
